I've been taking a lot of pictures with the best camera is the one on you. In
other words the iPhone. And it takes such wonderful pictures. Tashi is 4 months
and more than 2 weeks old now. He smiles because he loves it. He smiles because
that's as natural as kicking his legs. Code phrases in sing song such as 'Good
Morning!' bring forth a torrent of smiles. I'm so trigger happy! This is a
sudden change in the last two weeks.

And the most amazing thing happened: all of the evening he was quietly
playful. Sitting in my lap, chewing his _chador_, smiling at me.  Spending time
with us in a restful content way. At night instead of the 20 minute pacing in
the cool hallway (which always got him to sleep), he gurgled, he cooed, he
played wiht Sheetal's hair and he fell asleep. No patting, no breastfeeding, no
pacing, and no tears. Indeed this is the first time in 4 months he fell asleep
on his own.

Was it the 3 hour nap he took in mine and Dad's arms? I dont know.

This day, my coworker left Mozilla for Apple.
