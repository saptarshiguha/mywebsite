I spent a lot of time the last two days to have a web interface to my Jekyll blog engine. Now instead of writing markdowns then Jekyll on a remote server I can access a website that takes my post and runs Jekyll on it.

Also every ten minutes I have a cron job that commits new posts.

Pictures you ask? Yes that was the most tedious and that&#39;s being webified too!

More posts to come. Because it&#39;s easy as typing on a phone.
