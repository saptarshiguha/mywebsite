It’s been nearly a month since I last wrote. To be precise, since I last wrote
here. I’ve been assiduously jotting notes in my Google doc sheet. So while Tashi
is asleep recovering from his first ear infection, I shall collate these
entries.

**26th April**. I thought he had recovered but he had a lingering cough and
‘goopy eyes’ (as the nurses described it). We noticed the goopy eyes on a day
trip to the Monet exhibit at the Legion of Honor. The exhibit showcased his
early years before 34(ish). At the prodigal age of 17, he displayed his work at
the Salon. It turns out that Sheetal is quite a Monet fan and was quite overcome
with the plentitude of posters to buy. So she bought 3.

I kept Tashi front facing at the exhibit. Need to expose him to art. One
particular painting of the Virgin with baby and two angels caught his
attention. Narcissism much? He stared at it continuously.  The next day we took
Tashi to the doctor. Turns out he has an ear infection and he is the first human
I ve seen who sticks his tongue out to enjoy his amoxycillin.

We’re all down with some infection. Both Sheetal and I are on antibiotics. I’m
irked with myself, in that i believe that the my zero exercise life has
contributed to my decreased immunity.

**21 April** We joined a local parenting co-op called the Froggy Hill parents
coop. A group of parents that help each sit their children and give their kids
for sitting. A warm and friendly bunch, with a lot of administrative
trivia. Such as quarterly taxes(you give points), and the rule of one sit (you
sit a child and get points) and give your child for sitting (you pay points) and
finally everyone must host a social once a quarter. Seems fair, let’s see how
stressful these things become.

**18 April** The imaginary idea if a country is revealed in articles
like
[this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/nov/10/how-to-cook-perfect-porridge). And
more so in ‘fine art’ pictures of countries showing their locals. For
example, the tourist books of Ireland have mostly featured pictures of several
generation white irish folk doing irish things. No mention or depiction of
immigrant communities. The typical Australian is the surfer/cricketer/lover of
outdoors and is either white or aboriginal. Likely no display of the large
swathes of asian communities there.

So when do the immigrants become part of the imagined idea of a country? I’m
being unfair, immigration at the levels we see between countries has been on the
surge.

**16th April** Tashi goes to daycare and though our bouts of puking and his
feverish appearance disappeared his hoarse voice persisted. Soon in addition to
his hoarse voice like a baby reaching boyhood his coughing started. Two nights
again he coughed through the night. Pinch me for being mean but his coughing
shortened bis wake up crying spells. A troubled delivery mechanism cannot but
give up on crying! What to do? We fed him a ginger brewed water, we rubbed his
chest with garlic oil.  We even applied some Vicks to his chest. He had reviving
chicken soup which sent him into delightful kicking frenzy. And finally some
Zarbees syrup.  The night went smoothly without a single cough. Just listening
to his 15 minute siren wail is enough to tell me he is recovering.

Last week because of a misreading (mostly likely because of a very talkative
nurse) the doctor misread his weight as being a pound below normal. When you're
the in teens of pounds even a pound off is a serious issue. The doctor was
extremely concerned and we came home thinking how to get more milk into this
body? The doesn't seem to be any more opportunity. Two days went by like this
fretting about his weight loss, the development consequences and a niggling
skepticism about his reported with loss which didn't match his roly poly
nature. We weighed him at Noe valley peds and it turns out he is exactly on
track! I can't describe the relief.

**10th April** I believe we caught our first bug from Tashi. Tashi, Sheetal and
I went to Angel Island for the first time. A lovely little island a 30 minute
ferry ride away, there is nothing much to expect lounge on the beach, take a
refreshing hike around the island and if you’re well planned, stay the night in
a tent. It is nice however to escape the city and see it from across the water.
But in the evening of, Sheetal felt her stomach bloated and waves of nausea
persisted. Not to be left behind my mum, who hadn’t gone to Angel Island also
felt nauseous. None of other islanders were experiencing anything. Soon the
there were frequent rushes to the bathroom. Sheetal vomited her guts out, tashi
was fast asleep and I began to feel queasy. Queasy enough that I puked , or
rather hurled with preternatural force my innards out. Feeling feverish, i slept
through the night. The next morning i hear my mum puked too!  And then began the
interrogation of foods eaten. What could have been it? Squash was blamed, but it
couldn't have taken so long (for the reaction)? It turns out several people
Sheetal knew , all of whom handle children (nannies, new parents) had similar
symptoms.

So it could have been via sheetal or Tashhi! For he has started daycare and the
blighter is bringing back gifts for his parents.

He himself appeared mildly feverish and his smile was wan. It was oh s pitiful
as he whimpered and yelled with hoarse voice and yet managed to give us wan
smiles.

Two days later, good to see he is back in kicking action.

**9th April** He turned 6 months and he has started proto crawling (bum in the
air, stuck). He is quite the expert at sitting up straight without assistance!

I was playing Emmylou Harris and rocking Tash to a dozing but eyes open
state. He was so tired he fell asleep in my arms almost instantly. With the
lights dimmed and the music soft I let him fall asleep there. Sheetal called it
my weak moment since I've been all about getting him into bed with his eyes open
so he falls asleep using own devices.

It was tender moment holding the warm ball of livingness. Just a humming warm
ball who a few minutes back was kicking laughing and making all sorts of baby
noises.

I remembered dad would ask how much we loved him and knowing well how the game
is played we said a billion to the power of billion. And then we grew out of it
and we wouldn't give him an answer or did but forced. I myself might play the
same game knowing how much pleasure it will give me and I know I will share the
same fate as my fathers when Tashi grows out of it.
