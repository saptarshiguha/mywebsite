Like so many photographers, I find clouds enchanting. Personally, I find
them best viewed in black and white, their textures and folds being dramatized
in shades of grey. Color appears to be distracting and doesn't have the
sensitivity to the contrast present in clouds. 

Do clouds always appear so foreboding? I think the photos below, maybe somewhat
overdone, represent an idea of 'reality' which I see and attempt to describe in
pictures to you. With the help of Fuji XT1 and Lightroom.

Speaking of hardware, I feel a 56mm(90 mm full frame) or a wide lens e.g. 21 mm
bring the breath and framing of clouds. Some of my cloud fascination can be
found [here]({{site.url}}/{% post_url 2015-02-12-here-is-athought %}) and

What to Read While On The Pot
-----------------------------

I really liked one of Dan Albergotti poems I squirreled away  some time back (see
[this]({{site.url }}/{% post_url 2015-08-20-ektar-rexie %}) ).
And today while siting on the thinking throne I came across another one of hers.

{% poem %}
**Things to Do in the Belly of the Whale**  
by Dan Albergotti  
Measure the walls. Count the ribs. Notch the long days.  
Look up for blue sky through the spout. Make small fires  
with the broken hulls of fishing boats. Practice smoke signals.  
Call old friends, and listen for echoes of distant voices.  
Organize your calendar. Dream of the beach. Look each way  
for the dim glow of light. Work on your reports. Review  
each of your life's ten million choices. Endure moments  
of self-loathing. Find the evidence of those before you.  
Destroy it. Try to be very quiet, and listen for the sound  
of gears and moving water. Listen for the sound of your heart.  
Be thankful that you are here, swallowed with all hope,  
where you can rest and wait. Be nostalgic. Think of all  
the things you did and could have done. Remember  
treading water in the center of the still night sea, your toes  
pointing again and again down, down into the black depths.

Color Vancouver
---------------

In my last trip to Vancouver, I elected to stay in a hotel in North Vancouver that
overlooked the ocean. The water bus was wonderfully reliable and the hotel a
very pleasant ten minute walk through the promenade. The water bus hasn't had a
single accident in it's lifetime and watching the city recede was a great
metaphor for the day (not that i didn't take my work home).  

Without fail I was greeted by the very long ship you see above. While walking
home, i chanced upon what i assumed the same ship in an art gallery. The 'same'
ship even appeared on the hotels website. Could this be some Vancouver art
installation?  I turned to the great library in the sky, the internet.   

So i'm guilty of tanker racism. They don't all look the same, but many of them
travel from distant countries and dock in the harbor. Twenty years ago, my
manager would read the newspapers to discover new ships, where they came
from. Now we have the same library in the sky;
[this](http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-123.1/centery:49.3/zoom:13)
website will keep you entertained for *hours*.
