**Thu Sep  8 20:44 PDT 2016**  There are innumerable reasons, such as the 65 quotes listed
[here](http://www.latterdaymorning.com/65-brilliant-quotes-to-motivate-you-to-write-in-a-journal/),
to keep a journal. My mother kept a journal and on occasion would allow me to
read it. This book becomes a place to frame your thoughts and put to
paper. Memories that will soon be forgotten but  come flooding back when I read
the pages years later.

With the baby on his way any moment in the next month or so, this is going to
be a great time to record his development and my loss of hair. 

In every new endeavor much time is wasted on aesthetics and this CSS is an
attempt to get a different look for journal entries. Not sure if this separation
between blog and journal will actually work. But since this is a journal, I can
come back and confirm that, right?

P.S. I actually just changed all the entries post trip. So you have older
entries (uptil my London blog notes) and there after a new look.

P.P.S Will I ever change this really bad logo?
