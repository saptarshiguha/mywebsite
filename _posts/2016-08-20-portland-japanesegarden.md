 One of things I missed in the 3 times i've been to Portland was the Japanese Tea
Garden. In some sense I missed it again. The place was still under
construction, however a lot of it was ready.  

Everything is so pristinely beautiful. There is an air of very carefully
maintained balance. From the delicate leaves with  carefully trimmed branches to 
 the reed with water dripping ever so slowly .

A quietly humming stillness? Even that sounds too busy. And to remove the word
'humming' you might think I'm describing a tomb. But the tea garden is quite the
opposite: full of life, from fish to foliage.  

The best I can think of, is that you can hear  nature introspecting herself.
