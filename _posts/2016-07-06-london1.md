A trip to England. It poured rain and split sunshine by accident. The
gods were to quick mop up the sunshine leaving the wet mess for me to
enjoy.
        
Pointed the blad with Portra 400.

We met this lovely couple from who had been cycling for nearly 5000 miles over
the past several months. I had never seen so many bags on a cycle ever
let alone a *tandem* cycle!.  And what a surprise, they're from Santa
Cruz. Respect!

A picturesque English village (and there are so many!) called
 [Lacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacock). The union jacks are fluttering
 for the Queens 90'th birthday.
