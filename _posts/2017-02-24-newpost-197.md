Two adorable developments:

- with his little hands, he clawed/rubbed at the pages. My inference was that he
  was trying to turn the pages. And when i half turned the pages for him,
  indeed, he completed the turn. Given a book has something like 20 page turns
  and he is read to nearly every day, he has gotten a lot of receptive exposure
  to learn that. Such a pity his muscles/nerves don't respond to his heart.
  
- he started grabbing his feet. And then used his feet to hit the toys (well
  hitting here is a proxy for trying to hold on to).
  
On another note, Trump rescinded protections/rights for transgender students to
use restrooms. Bannon is on the ascendant. Immigrants are being forced back in
droves. Everything about him is ugly, noxious and mendacious. I feel powerless to
do anything.
