We took a stroll in the SF Botanical gardens which is free on the 2nd sunday for
everyone. What a pleasant surprise. Tashi was enthralled by the
geese. Everything smelled fresh and we took a slow and windy drive around n'er
seen parts of San Francisco. Stopping at he crests of hills in the Castro and
Diamond Heights neighborhood, we surveyed the beauty present in all the four
directions of this sometimes-not-foggy city.
