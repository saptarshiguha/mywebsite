A few weeks back my brother visited for a conference. The highlights
were fabulous french food at Msr. Benjamin and the stupendous cycle
ride with Jijo and Sheetal around the Paradise loop. About 50 miles of
cycling, at a strolling pace (8 hours outside and 4 hours of
cycling). But what was immensely satisfying was managing to cycle up
Hawk Hill. That hill always stood nigh high and impossible in my
head. And a with some heavy breathing and a steady pace I managed it.

<br/> Which will goes to show that (at the risk of being evangelical)
that a lot of fears are in our head (in this case, fear of
failure). And with a bit of practice, conquering some things are is a
just a matter of being slow and steady. These photos are with the very
trusty Moto X Pure (edited in VSCO)
