The <a href='https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos'>Talos
project</a> is Mozilla's internal QA tool for testing the quality of
Firefox builds. Commits to different branches of Firefox get batched,
compiled and tested on a battery of test suites. Some are unit tests
and many others performance tests. My ongoing work is cataloging the
different tests for their testing efficacy. One essential criteria is
that the variation in the test is small compared to it's mean.
</p>

<p> Visualization is crucial to understanding these tests. The tests
are run on a combination of hardware platforms, e10s builds, and
compile options. There can be several hundred visualization to
study. The graphing tool I'll be using is <a
href='https://github.com/bokeh/rbokeh'>rbokeh</a>, an R interface to
the Bokeh graphing tool. One limitation as I see it is that printing
the figure object at the R console opens a new browser tab/window
every time. Rather, I'd have the output sent to one file and all I'd
need to do is reload the browser window.

In <a
href='https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools/blob/master/R/html_print.R#L41'>https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools/blob/master/R/html_print.R#L4</a>
`html_print`, doesn't have an option on how and where to write
the HTML , it always creates anothe temporary directory and writes the
HTML there.  The following code handles that in that it uses a fixed
directory and copies the data to that fixed directory. On my remote
system, `~/public_html/rbokeh` can be viewed in Chrome (which
has the added advantage of viewing PDFs in the browser).
