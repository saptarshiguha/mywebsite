We took a short trip to Seattle, driving down to Portland. A couple of days
later Rahul joined us and offed it to Crater Lake. From Crater Lake back to
Portland and then finally to Seattle.  
 
It wasn't the best of journeys. Sheetal was quite sick, one entire roll of 35mm
failed to shoot (i have now correctly learned how to load the  camera) and my
general memory is a *lot of* driving.  

With that out of the way, things I recall, are lovely walks in Capitol Hill
neighborhoods, the water tank up there, watching a man dance slowly with bad ass
sword, egg burritos in Portland, the lovely dogs Reba and Bandit at the AirBNB,
a fun night at an the McKinley Resort in Portland, a lovely evening cooking and
chatting with Sue in  the balmy evening in Oregon   and the last evening in Rahuls
local bar, Annapurna.   

Phew!  

And I'm thankful for the lovely night sky an hour from Crater Lake, in the middle
of nowhere. Sheetal got us in the car and we drove to the lake and the Milky
Way was a band of dust you couldn't miss even with sunglasses on. Shooting stars
could be mistaken for viscous drops of light falling from the sky.

An hour from crater lake with a night sky to die under, up above and
down below, gnats swarmed us. Only in the cool moist morning did I get some
respite.

And now we move to Portland. Still keeping it weird all these years (zoom in to
read the sign on the car).
