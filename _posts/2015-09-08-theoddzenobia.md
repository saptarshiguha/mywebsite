I came across a  Zenobiaflex II twin lens reflex camera on Ebay for less than $100. Packed in a lovely burgundy burnished leather
case that reminded me of my grandfathers almirah, this was pleasure to behold. In fact, it's so unassuming and fun to use, Sheetal has 
adopted it as her very own camera. The viewing screen is slightly blurry and it does come with a loupe.

Unfortunately, we haven't quite figured out how to use it - there is a shutter cock button, and another knob at the bottom of the lens
that winds. But what is it used for? As can be seen from the following two rolls of TriX400 and Portra 400(pulled to 200),
 we still haven't learned. 

 This model of camera was manufactured by Daiichi K≈çgaku in the 1950s (so this makes it somewhat like  60 years old) and comes with
 a 75/3.5 Neo-Hesper lens. For more details see <a href="http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Zenobiaflex"> here</a>.
