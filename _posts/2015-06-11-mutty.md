<p> The running joke that San Francisco has more dogs than children sounds true
	if you go to a park. They come alive with the sounds of dogs barking and
	their owners calling after them. Dogs run, amble and walk to the skirt of
	the Pacific Ocean, tongues lolling, owners laughing as the sun sets on the
	western coast.  </p> <p> But the dogs without this life end up in shelters
	where they wait for someone to come along and adopt them. The older ones
	wait the longest. This pained Sherri Franklin, a long time animal welfare
	volunteer and once the Commissioner of Animal Control and Welfare for San
	Francisco. A lot of the older dogs want nothing more than to rest or amble
	Much like older humans, their eyes and ears might fail them. And though they
	may not be the bouncy energetic dogs that we are used to seeing on TV, they
	still have plenty of life left in them and a lot of love to give.  </p> <p>
	Sheri ought to know: she started Muttville Senior Dog Shelter eight years
	ago. Between the shelter, Sherri's home and those of other volunteers,
	Muttville houses seniors dogs that have been abandoned or whose owners could
	not care for . She's been on Oprah and Muttville has won a string of
	best-shelter awards. Muttville collaborates with other shelters, dog-swap
	programs across the country and even private pilots who fly dogs from place
	to place .To date, they have managed to get 3,000 dogs adopted!  </p> <p>
	Muttville is located at Alabama and 16th St, within walking distance of
	SCPA, Family Dog Home (who work with dark-colored cats and dogs as these too
	are also less likely to be adopted) and the city shelter. Fittingly, the
	city renamed that block Rescue Row.  </p>

<p> Around 5 months back, I decided to volunteer my Friday mornings to
	Muttville. I grew up with a labrador spaniel called Jake and have always
	adored larger dogs, but the opportunity to keep one. The reasons have been
	many: building rules, lack of space or long working hours that would have
	kept me away from my friend.. By volunteering at Muttville, I was able to
	get my ‘dog fix.’ It turns out that getting one’s dog fix is a popular
	enough desire that a shelter in Kauai, Hawaii pairs shelter dogs with
	dog-loving visitors to accompany them on their island hikes. Many go on and
	adopt their furry guide.  </p>


<p> Friday mornings start around half-past-seven and continue for two and half
	to three hours. You know you’re needed because the dogs have woken up and
	greet you and everyone else with a highway of howling, yapping and
	barking. And when you cross the barrier, there is the lap sitting, licking
	and tail wagging. It’s a great way to start your day. Very quickly the
	amount of work to be done dawns on you.  </p> 

<p> My human friends there include Jeremiah, whose responsibility at Muttville
	is to prepare food and medications. Then there’s Steve who does a lot of
	administrative work and helps with the dog walking. I’ve always enjoyed
	dogs, but having spent time in the company of Sherri, Steve and Jeremiah, I
	know what truly unconditional dog love is like. At any given time there are
	around 20 to 30 dogs at Muttville, mostly smaller ones, though there are a
	handful of bigger ones All the dogs are people-friendly and enjoy the tummy
	rub and a hug. Once harnessed, which is important--because dogs no matter
	their age can squirm their way out of collars and then it’s a two-legged vs
	four-legged race-- the dog walking begins. These morning walks that are the
	best. Older dogs adore the sight of the leash and can’t wait to get out. And
	in the early morning before the sun is out, a nip sings in the air, we take
	walks around this block or that block led by our dogs. It’s a great
	moment. You can’t really use a cell phone and walk the dogs together, so I
	ignore my phone, and enjoy the tranquility of the moment instead. And almost
	every passerby smiles at the dogs as they sniff and mark the road as their
	own.  </p> <p> As the hours go by, windswept from the licks and the San
	Francisco weather, we separate the dogs for feeding time. Food brings out
	some dog personalities much like it does in humans. Some dogs have to be
	separated because they won’t be satisfied with their share. But once the
	dogs have wolfed the food down or been hand-fed, and some few amble over and
	empty their bladders, a calm settles. A welcome moment when there are only
	three dog walkers. It's exhausting but I start my day with a satisfied
	exhaustion. With hot coffee in our hands and warm dog to cuddle, it’s really
	better than a Friday to start the weekend.  </p> <p> Muttville’s mission is
	“... dedicated to changing the way the world thinks about and treats older
	dogs, aged seven years and older, and to creating better lives for them
	through rescue, foster, adoption, and hospice.”  </p> <p> Come over and
	visit. Even better, come over and adopt. Every Saturday and Sunday.  </p>
