A lot of us who grew up with digital cameras are now enjoying the pleasure
film photography. Nearly all digital camera have auto ISO, auto exposure, auto
everything and analog photography for the most part does not have luxuries like
that. Once you've chosen your film stock, your ISO is fixed for the next 36
photos. And with the older cameras, estimating the appropriate exposure and
shutter speed is a decision left to you. Tools exist to help, such as a light
meter but it's incredibly useful to be able to judge, at the very least, the
difference in exposure values in different parts of a scene and the overall
exposure value of a scene (e.g. the sunny sixteenth rule and Ken Rockwells [here](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/ev.htm)
 

 Though I've been  trying to estimate these values, I'm thankful my
 Leica M7 has auto exposure. Pointing at the shadows and locking exposure gives
 me some control over the look. Metering for film is vital for a lovely
 tonality. Johnny Patience's blog entry on metering film, and this review of
 Portra exposed / underexposed is a go to reference for the internet
 generation. In short, use a light meter, learn to guess the exposure value, and
 expose for the shadows. Also some films benefit from being a stop overexposed
 (too much overexposure reduces film contrast).


 When I used my Fuji XT1, before the update to shutter speeds like 1/32000, i
 couldn't shoot wide open (e.g. 1.4) without totally blowing highlights. Film,
 I'm happy to say is something else. The photos below are Portra 400 rated at
 200 and shot between f/1.5 - f/2. I nearly always exposed for the
 shadows. Note, not all film stocks are so forgiving. I believe TriX and NeoPan
 are better when 'correctly' exposed, say 3 stops here or there. And Ektar is
 best when shot without much latitude. Not that you can't recover but the
 beautiful bold colors of Ektar are best when the exposure range is balanced.


Surprisingly  PSI, the Pakon Scanning Software, saw blown highlights. I was
definitely disappointed. But a scan through TLX revealed exemplary tonality and
light reproduction. Surprise! Moreover, I've decided that ColorPerfect is not
worth the effort - I barely seem to understand the interface and TLX/PSI give me
wonderful scans anyway.
