The colors of Ektar, the colors of Velvia. Rendered with the definitely lovely
Fuji 35mm/f2.  Very sharp, very light, easy to use. Lacks the solidity of a
Zeiss lens, but what does match the sheer presence of a Leica with it's Zeiss
entourage?

Pictures taken with the final look and crop in mind. I really am advancing, if
not in vision but in knowing what I want from the image and using the camera as
a means to get it.


And did I say? Happy Birthday Sheetal!! It's great knowing you so keep getting
 older so I can keep getting to know you.
