*Fri Nov 6th* Elections tomorrow. How does Hillary feel (i can't get myself to
imagine how Trump feels: he is so full of himself is he even capable of feeling
anxiety and excitement?). Tashi is wriggling his feet in excitement !

Here's to Hillary. The 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote and maybe
after 57 elections and more than 200 years, the US might have it's first woman
president!

Wishing her all the best.
