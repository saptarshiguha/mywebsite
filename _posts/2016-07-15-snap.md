{% poem %}

On a cold and windy day  
I hung my camera bag out to dry  
In the ochre breezy sun  
It took the slip  
my bag  chose to fly  
 
 
Up and away in the thermals  
Along with the frigates & terns  
Over ocean , river, cliff and  spur  
Resting with the crickets  
in the soft  green verge  
Always restless.  Always growing  
Never resting on its padded arse  
My bag flew away. To the corners of this earth  
It left with a camera  
The one  in  my heart  
Tell me bag o’ plenty where do you be  
Tell me bag o’ plenty how do you feel?  
Tell me bag o’ plenty what do you see  
My dearest bag,  
set me free.
