*Thursday Dec 12,2016* I write this at the start of Tashis ninth(or tenth? such
a blur) week. So it's been two weeks in the interim. In these two weeks he has
put on a pound if not more, took off in an airplane and landed ,not once but
twice , been changed under the shade of a tree, on a warm car bonnet , been fed
on a beech, under a tree, in a bed overlooking the ocean and to the sunset. Gosh
the common thing here is that he also always had his mouth to nipple and
feeeding. and in between, cooing, gurgling, smiling and seeing new sights galore.

It appears we are lucky he didn't complain with the cabin pressure change and
slept throughout the ride and woke up eyes agog to the sight of so many people.

All this occurred in the big island of Hawaii where Mozilla had one of their
work weeks. We spent five days in Waikoloa with 1200 employees and 800 family
members. Read that sentence twice. And everyone was in the same hotel, the
Hilton, very cultivated Disneyesque, with an eclectic choice in art, did have the
exquisite  Pacific ocean in front of them. The grounds made for very restorative
walks much needed after too many drinks and many more Mozillians.

We spent five days talking drinking, planning and laughing.

Sheetal, baby,I and mother in law went there some three days before and explored
the northern part of Hawaii. It was beautiful but a bit of a washout 
with the incessant rain, and Tashis very frequent desire to feed meant Sheetal
couldn't do may activities she enjoys doing.  But the few we did afforded
memorable views and yielded many beatific cries of delight.

All pictures with Fuji XT1 (using the Helios 44-2 lens) and the iPhone 7+

Some objet d'art from Hiltons own museum walkway. One wing is inspired by Asian mythologies
and another wing changes to European style landscapes reminiscent of Turner. No
idea who chose what went where.
