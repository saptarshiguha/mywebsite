San Francisco City Hall was completed in 1915 after 27 years of
  planning. The building is in fact taller than the Capitol and  was finished
  just in time for the Pacific Panama International Exposition( Palace
  of Fine Arts played a role in that exposition). The City Hall is an impressive
  hall with notable history.  I have nothing new to add. Dear Reader, read
