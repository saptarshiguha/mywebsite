Oh rex! A bit of clarity/sharpening does justice to the Zeiss 35mm lens. Throw in a medium a contrast curve
and does Ektar look unbeatable.

{% poem %}
simply, silently, knowingly,  his eyes track  
our meandering movements, to the door  
quietly, patiently, finally, sees our back  
and  warms  to the floor  
the field is warmed by a blazing  arc  
the orange, grimy saliva orb chewed to perfection  
he madly pulls us to the golden green park  
powered by hours of bored reflection  
and on and on he runs and jumps  
his canine toys, his air and space  
one eye afar, the other on us  
sprint, slobber, jump and race  
quietly we stroll our ways to home  
in him i choose to recognize  
at peace,we contently feed ourselves,  
and so i'm able to  empathize  
dogs, I know, are canine,   
but the dog i love is leonine

 An evocative poem I read recently in the Writer's Almanac. I read it
 many times over for the feeling and images to sink in. If only I
 could memorize it!


{% poem %}
Inside by by Dan Albergotti  
In the lake, the cottonmouth. In the sea, the shark.  
In the soil, the growing seed. In the tree, the lark.
  
In the dark, the insectsâ€™ call. In the light, the trust.  
In the child, the weight of years. In the steel, the rust.  
  
In the dust, the memory. In the air, your soul.  
In my head, the unsaid words. In the diamond, coal.  
  
In the hole, your polished box. In the earth, the quake.  
In my blood, your vessel ran. In these lines, its wake.
