We rocked and boated all the way the Farallon Islands. 22 miles of a nausea
    inducing, freezing windswept boat ride. In the distance whales (grey,humpack
    and a blue?) were spouting like a spoof of whack-a-mole cartoon. Like a
    looking at historic buildings, one sees the tip and imagines the rest. Below
    the 40 spouts lie 40 most amazing creatures on this planet.


And one whale breached. It was magnificient.
