Tashi’s first day at daycare. We took him to Lolli’s place which is 3 block way
from our home. He had no problem being dropped off and he spent 4 hours
there. Playing with toys and interacting with other children. My first time with
him in the care of strangers, i feel these little tremors of having lost
him. Not being under my extended care, it feels like we’ve lost each other on a
big ship! But all is well. He came back his smiley self and apparently didn't
even look at sheetal as she left. As usual he didn't sleep when left alone, but
did in the pram. I get a few hours with him when i come back. Eager, more than
ever to see his adorable grins, i tossed him many times in the air. Yes, it's 
still there :)

Mum and Sheetal went to pick him up and according to Mum, he was pursed and
stared at sheetal for a few blocks. ‘Abhimaan’ is what mum said,”how could you
leave me alone” was what tashi was thinking …

He went the next day too and it appears he loved it even more. He greeted Lolli
with eye to eye grins, drank chicken soup and upon his return was his happiest
ever. So it seems he gets to meet human his size, play and be well taken care
of. I'm feeling much better. But there are subtle changes every week, changes I
can't put my finger on. As i told my whatsapp group,  one enjoys the cuddly
football the most the day you realize they've changed and then you want to go
back a week.

Otherwise, a normal day. I have a presentation about Sequential Experiments
tomorrow. We gifted Jijo his whiskey but he couldn’t come home for us to sample
it. My loss! 

This is him packed and ready to go  to india.

Yesterday was Tashi’s annaprashan. It was a small affair with Jijo, Ashrith, Mum
and SHeetal and of course Tashi. Farah my neighbor dropped in and showed his
latest photographic project. He is always an interesting person to be in the
company off. Tashi wanted to eat everything but sadly nothing could be given. He
ultimately picked the music and pencil. Alas no books!

_Camera Insights_

With an insight, i realized my mistake of buying the Contax G2. If you search
for this camera, you only get *glowing* reviews. What Google doesnt tell you, is
out of a tiny group of film photographers only a fraction use the contax g2 and
and even small fraction still use it. They will obviously love and rave about
it. Naturally, you'll never see a bad review nor will you have an idea of how
niche it is. So in the throws of your latest GAS you buy this costly camera and
realize this is not the experience you were looking for.

I bit the bullet and am in the process of selling the Fuji 35mm/f2. I took some
photos with the 56mm/1.2 along with  the 35mm/2 and they were bitingly sharp! So much
so, i did a double take when i saw the photos. The 35mm/1.4 has a soft-sharp (a
strange adjective i came across on the net but i think i get it). When the light
has been caught just right, the 35mm/1.4 *glows* without an exceeding sharpness
to it. I like the 56mm for it’s perfect images, but the 35mm/1.4 is understated.
