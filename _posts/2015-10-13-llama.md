Two years ago Sheetal met Rojo the therapy llama at Portland (during
Portlands pumpkin festival). He was all dolled up and adorable as
ever. This weekend we visited Portland  for a little weekend
relaxation and hoped to see Rojo and friends again. Sadly, Rojo was
not on duty!! Well, trying out our luck we called Mtn Peaks Therapy LLamas
and Lori answered. Lori and her daughter Shannon run the Mtn
Peaks Therapy Llamas and Alpacas along with Rojo, Smokey, Napolean,
Jean-Pierre,  Andre, and Little Chap. 

Lori was unbelievabley kind and gracious to invite us to meet, hug and
get llama love right at her home. A short drive from Portland, we
managed to feed, walk, and learn from Lori the love and caring
required to keep llamas and alpacas. For myself, it took a few minutes
of trusting Lori, but once you hug a llama you want to hug and hug and
hug. They are very unique and endearing creatures.


It's so wonderful that Lori has these adorable creatures by her side
every day, and equally wonderful that Rojo and company are lucky to have such a
wonderful person as Lori in their lives.

All these pictures were taken with  Fuji XT1 along with a Zeiss 50mm/1.5 Sonnar attached. As you can see from
Sheetal's dress, my colors are out of whack. It's actually grey but in it appears 
multiple shades of grey in various pictures.
