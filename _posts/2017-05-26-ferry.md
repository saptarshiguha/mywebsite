i visited my brothers and sis-in-laws place in Manchester, CT. The vegetation is
starkly different from the bay area. Rolling hills of a  myriad shades of
green. Lush forests and shaggy overgrown trees surround my brothers house for
miles  around. He took my mum and I for a lovely drive around Glastonbury
where I saw the statue of Webster (of Merriam Webster fame) and the United
States' oldest running ferry (since 1630!). I love the ferry rides in the bay
area mostly because of the gorgeous scenery, but the ferries that give me my fix
are the small ones like the one we went on. Small enough to fit 3 -4 cars, a
little tugboat pulls the ferry across the Connecticut River. Each ride is $5
and you call the ferrymen from the other side with a little honk  of your
horn. I could have ridden up this 100m little ride the entire day, but the
setting sun and the polite but firm ferrymen would not have it.
