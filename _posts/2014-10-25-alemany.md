Alemany Farmers Market is, I find out, California's first farmers market. A
place to sell excess produce. What i like about it is it's decidedly no frills
approach. Come here, buy vegetables. Prices are reasonable. Other farmer markets
appear rather indulgent. Vegetables are  a mixture of latino and asian
produce. And the food from the wood fired pizza to the tacos at  El Huarache
Loco are so damn good.

Did I mention I used the XT1 and Helios 44-2? The Helios 44-2, of swirly bokeh fame, is
gorgeous. And your best chance of achieving it is by placing the subject in
front of foliage. Foliage goes in the swirly blender with this lens.
