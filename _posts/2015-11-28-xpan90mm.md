I purchased the 90mm lens for the XPAN. The 30mm quite out of financial scope I found to my dismay thea
frame lines were not changing for the 90mm! The internet took me to Nippon PhotoClinic, a tiny shop in New York City
that fixes XPAN cameras. Thankfully they didn't need to send it to Germany, not that the local fix was much costlier.

Anyways, the view is wonderful and I will say, it's quite good for portraits!
