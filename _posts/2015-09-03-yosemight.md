We had a another trip with Jatin and Deesha this time to Yosemite. And from
this trip, I've seen another aspect of Yosemite, a view I hadn't seen
before. The four of us drove up to Yosemite at a very leisurely pace and took
I40 up to a lovely little AirBNB place 10 miles from Mariposa. The families'
food needs were almost purely self contained, with kale,cabbage, lettuce and
other greens grown in the patch behind them, all manner berries, potatoes,
carrots, lemon trees, oranges too and this year figs.  They have managed to
squeeze every drop of water they can through an elaborate multi layered
irrigation and soil layout.  Mowing was done by Billy the horse that greets you
above. 



Mariposa can be massively hot and Yosemite can be amazingly
crowded. So crowded in fact that the road to Glacier Point was blocked because
of traffic and a ranger had to do traffic control. Expect to wait an hour in
traffic. In a national park. Huh. It was rather disappointing because we very
likely spent more time in traffic than sniffing air.


But our hosts gave us the excellent suggestion of visiting Tuolumne
Meadows, which was empty and we were rewarded with swims in Lake
Tenaya (which at 5000-7000ft, is cold if you don't swim). The meadow
is in the opposite direction of the valley and aware from much of the
crowds. This left with us an easy journey back to the valley and a
short Mist Falls hike. 


The pictures below are a mix of Portra
160, Ektar 100 on a Hasselblad and Trix400 on a Leica M7 with the
Voigtlander 21mm.

It was only a sunny smile, and little it cost in the giving  
but like morning light it scattered the night and  
made the day worth living
