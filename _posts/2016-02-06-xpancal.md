The December of last year took me  home to Calcutta.  Being with
Sheetal, the stay in India is divided between Bangalore and Calcutta. When I see images
of Calcutta, they have a shabby, fallen look, and it's so easy to forget
that the city is so vibrant. Photos of dusty french windows,  vines creeping
unbridled across building walls making their way into the frames of the
building.  Broken brick walled garbage vats letting their
contents flow in abandon and  so many beautiful homes, that have lost their
owners love, sunken in disrepair, their families locked in legal
dispute.

And yet, traffic is choc a bloc, people are arguing at every tea
stall, loving  every cup of saccharine sweet coffee, and
lamenting the current state of the nation, sports, the world and  the lives of
others. 


The XPAN is a panoramic camera that shoots 65x24 negatives. I took some
Ektar 100 to Calcutta to see it through the XPANS's eyes. A google
search doesn't turn up  much. I wish to leave its mark here and in
Google's forever archive. That the XPAN went to Kolkata and it is very
much alive.


Some of these pictures are from Gariahat crossing, others from New
Market. The carrom board that is staple of the Calcutta youth. Its
abandon a positive sign for the workforce. The tram that refused to
move that day and Debuda the lemon tea seller that has remained


I also used the wonderful Plaubel Makina which might even become my camera of
choice. The fidelity in these 120 images are breathtaking ...

The above photo was taken at Gariahat crossing under the bridge. The market behind is a maze. You'll come 
in from entry and find yourself blinded in the sunlight as you exit from a completely different end

The spread of the New Market extends to the horizon. This was taken from the
"Blue and Beyond" located at the top of Hotel Lindsay. Views spread the width of
Calcutta with the New Market to one side and Park St and beyond to the other.
Supposedly a number of tourists come here and the menu has choices from across
the world. I still recommend the Indian chinese and a bottle of beer.

It's easy to forget that a city is alive and pulsates even when it's walls are
crumbling.

As you walkdown Rabindra Sarobar, yours eyes will focus on the beautiful banyan
tree that in one gesture manages to loom and grace simultaneously.

## Walking Around Calcutta


Ambitiously, I thought I'd take the 29 tram from Kalighat. The 29 meanders it's way through Calcutta
through Chetla, Kidderpore ending at Esplanade after it makes it way through the Maidan. The XPAN called
out for a ride but our dear tram driver rushed out to inform me that no trams would drive today. Could I walk the route?
Not yet prepared for the dusty walk, I came home to Debuda and his cups of reviving lemon tea at Deshapriya park.
