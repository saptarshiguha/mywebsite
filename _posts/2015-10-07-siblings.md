The following photos taken with the XT1 are a mix of quirky and metaphorical.
When capturing moments, as a the person with the camera,I decide which moment to
report but the which depends on how I perceive the expression, the moment, the
light  and how i join them together with apeture, film and time.

Something lies below the surface of a photo hidden,  to ourselves. some thoughts are barely thought.
Metaphors through film are unique to the viewer, the recorder and the recorded.  
What i see, what you see, and what they see?  
And you might notice some techniques here to convey that metaphor  

Or not. that's the beauty of it. these photos are for me. take that as you will.
On top lies the photo, below a false memory.
