1. *Sat Jan 28* Tashi slept for five hours straight. I
couldn't believe it. He cried his very best before that, Sheetal pacified him a
but and he slept of. I hardly slept expecting him to wake up any time. But any
time occurred at 2:30 in the morning.

2. He fed two boobs, and then it took 1 hour to get him to sleep again. We
steadfastly refused to pacify him. He then slept for two hours after.  So after
one night, our sleep training is not terribly bad. He didn't enter the bed
once. Feeding was restricted to a chair.
    
    We had the bed to ourselves ;)

3. I heard [Heartbeat by Claptone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSkulWT7V4M)
   after a long two hour interview and in the middle of hour long drive home. It
   was exhilarating, as much as exhilarating can be while sitting in a car in
   traffic. But for a moment, i felt like freeing myself from my body
   embarrassment by wearing the most figure hugging shorts, the tightest shirt
   and jumping in abandon to the song. This version of me does not exist even in
  an  alternate universe.
   
4. I was walking down 24'th street and i could smell the odor of food, of
   manufacturing, of character. Sometimes walking down American streets, the
   odors are neutral or of human waste. Walking the streets in Calcutta (i don't mean
   the garbage lanes), the aroma is rich and nuanced. It felt good smelling something
   with character.

A few adorable photos of Tashi when he was 3 months. Taken on Neopan 400 with a
Biogon 35mm/2 lens. Some other photos of when Neetika and her partner Rolli came
over from Australia.
