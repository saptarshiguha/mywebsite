A long time ago, around the beginning of July, Tashi fell asleep with a few tears, and slept for several (i mean in the 4-5&#39;s) hours straight, a quick feed followed by another straight arrow shot of uninterrupted sleep. Sheetal wrote this then.


{% poem %}
Mi Amor,  
Why so sore  
Tashi sleeps through the night  
And doesn&#39;t even put up  a fight  
What excuse not to swim  
To run to jog to gallop in the streets  
Of this beautiful city that greets  
You every morning with the blue  
Ocean behind you  
With a clock to remind you  
That you must swim, you run  
To keep your sanity you bum

But sadly, all good things come to an end and neither the sleep nor the exercise happen any more...
