Thinking in black and white is novel for me. I've been told it's pure and
simple, the photographer and viewer not distracted by the colors.  After maybe
20 rolls, I'm seeing the light that guides the uninitiated. Light and
shadows. Form and lines. Geometry and texture. These are the qualities that
black and white wants to work with. After spending exclusive time with B&W,
color becomes another dimension that needs to be incorporated into the
photo. There is so much to be learned and it comes through a lot of
practice. I'm only beginning to really appreciate the power of black and
white. Rather than limit it frees.   And then there is the medium format
look. The pictures below are taken with the Hasselblad. I have often wondered
what about the look cannot be captured in other formats. Apart from the
resolution, there is tonality. The black and white textures are thick and
viscous, luscious pasty ink strokes. I want to master the format and tools to
bring these out.   How beautiful would these look on cloth lined paper
prints?
