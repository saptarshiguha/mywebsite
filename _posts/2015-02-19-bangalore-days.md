My in laws live in Bangalore. Going back for about 10 days was a little like
a middle class prosaic Jason Bourne experience. Everything felt familiar, some roads
and left turns came  to me out of reflex, but I was still lost. From the
moment I land to the minute I arrive home, we are bombarded by advertisements
promising hours of relaxation, safety and joy in residential complexes that span
acres, have the greenest of greens, the bluest of skies and every amenity I can
think of. There is precious little space left inside Bangalore city, so the city
is gently moving outwards. The traffic in Bangalore is horrendous. People call
India's traffic chaotic. I wouldn't agree with that. It's co-operative
disorder. Essentially, follow the laws to <i>some</i> extent and look after
yourself. Pedestrians, drivers, and animals all understand this and work
together. But, soon your friends or the ones you socialize with will
be the ones who live close by for a few kilometer drive will take an hour or so at
least. I have much hope for the fledgling metro system. Clean and rapid
transport that desperately needs more links that span the city.

I also realized that 10 years in the US has taken its toll. I had tremendous
trouble breathing and requested closed windows for the first few days. It took
me 10 days to acclimatize to the weather. Fab India  now advertises to every
segment not just the intellectual left wing consumer (it is owned by some
exclusive French brand). And the city has breweries, active theater scene and
slowly becoming very costly for the average Bangalorean to live in. This as told
to me by a driver. It is unfortunately  when the locals cant live in their own
city. Similar sentiments heard in San Francisco.

 I don't have a comfort with the city to take pictures, so I didn't take
many. Actually time was spent looking for another home for Sheetal's mum. Her
mum spent many years in a lush sylvan nook in Kerala. Days of fresh clean air
overlooking backwaters and green groves and above all, the sound of
silence. Welcome Bangalore and the train, the dogs that bark at night which
simultaneously keep the neighborhood safe and deny you your sleep, and the
crows!. Yes, there is a lot of noise to tackle in Bangalore. All of which
conspire to deny peace and sleep to the uninitiated. So days were spent visiting
new properties. With what eye do we see these empty nascent spaces? With the
architects? the prospective owner?  the girl who sweeps the space? We all want a
home, a home with swathes of well maintained green, fountains, running water,
electricity, a guard to keep us safe, and yet these new ivory towers are at the
same time symbols of such inequity.
