More pictures with a Leica M7 and Tri-X 400. Brilliant vistas and skies to lie back and stare at. I will take this private opportunity
to say  I purchased a lovely Plaubel Makina 67. I shouldn't have, but gosh I so love a rangefinder. 
The lack of distraction from a view finder (it's just a glass
with a patch that aligns itself, but you're not given any idea of depth of field except through the lens DOF markers) 
makes the camera. A compose, point and click.

And it is medium format too. And black and white needs to be shot on a medium format. It really does.
