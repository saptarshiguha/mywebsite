Hadoop moves forward. Amazon marches with it. And so must RHIPE. This blog post
is about RHIPE working with the new Amazon Elastic MapReduce images.The R code
found
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6d70FmpKIi1a293S2FFZGwwYms/view?usp=sharing)
contains R code to start an Elastic Map Reduce cluster running R 3.1 and
RHIPE. This should start your cluster in ~ 6-7 minutes. The commands are

     emrMakeCluster(name=sprintf("%s's EMR Cluster",Sys.getenv("USER")), instances=3,loguri,keyname,bootstrap=NULL)

which starts a cluster with a give name, number of instances, a URI to keep the
logs, your AWS keyname, and URLS to S3 locations of any bootstrap scripts.
This is not ready for you the eager reader to copy,paste and run. Please edit
the source code to change the location of ``s3n://rhipeemr/kickstartrhipe.sh``
and ``s3://rhipeemr/final.step.sh``. Those files can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6d70FmpKIi1MTExelBGSzdfRTA/view?usp=sharing)
and
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6d70FmpKIi1V3FqY2FWcmFheUk/view?usp=sharing). You'll
need to download them, store them on S3 and update the R code.
This function returns a jobid, say J, which you can pass to
``emrDescribeCluster`` or ``emrWaitForStart`` (which will wait for the cluster
to start).

I promise you  these scripts work! But  you need to slightly  modify the source.
You  also  need 'aws'  (a  python  command line  tool  by  Amazon) and  a  valid
``~/.aws/{config,credentials}``  file. It  also  has Rstudio  server running  on
8787(username: metrics, password: metrics), but you'll  need the SSH proxy to be
running(  see ``aws  socks  help``).  I'm sure  you  have  questions, post  your
questions to the RHIPE google group.

Mean while in the cold cold cold empty streets of  Washington DC.
